# synapse-geometry: figure out stuff from synapse geometry in 3D data

Synapse-geometry is a python library to work with neuroimaging data at 
synapse-level resolution, distributed under the open-source

## Installation

Well, there's nothing to install per se (distutils support coming at some point
in the far future). Download the source and add whatever path you downloaded it
to to your Python path.
